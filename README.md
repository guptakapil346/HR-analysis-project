 ðŸ“Š The insights which I have gathered from this project are as follows:-
 
 a) Most employees who leave the company are between the ages of "26 and 35".
 
 b) The job role that see the most employees leaving is in the field of "Laboratory Technician".
 
 c) Employees who have been with the company for "1 to 2" years are more likely to leave compared to others. 
 
 d) Even though the average salary is "6.5k", employees who earn less than that are more likely to leave the company.
